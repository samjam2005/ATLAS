"""
Prompt templates for the Career layer.

Two generators, both returning strict JSON so the frontend can render
structured cards:

  build_profile_prompt()    → an evidence-backed career profile / resume
                              bullets, built from the mastery graph + the
                              assignments the student has actually completed.
                              This is the 'Sup "profile is the spine" idea:
                              fill it once, everything else pulls from it —
                              except here we auto-fill it from real coursework.

  build_interview_prompt()  → mock interview questions DRILLED ON the
                              student's real projects (not generic prompts),
                              mirroring 'Sup's Prep pillar.

Both prompts are shared across the Aether Copilot primary path and the Gemini JSON
fallback (see routers/career.py), so they must be self-contained.

def build_profile_prompt(
    profile_summary: str,
    target: str | None = None,

    """Build a prompt that turns a mastery-weighted coursework summary into a
    career profile + resume bullets as JSON."""

    target_block = ""
    if target:
        target_block = f"\n## Target\nTailor the positioning toward: {target}\n"

    return f"""You are a career coach building a candidate's professional profile from their VERIFIED academic record. Every claim must be grounded in the coursework below — do not invent experience.

## Student's Mastery-Weighted Coursework
{profile_summary}
{target_block}
## Your Task
Produce a profile a strong CS undergrad could put in front of a recruiter. Lead with the highest-mastery, most differentiated skills. Resume bullets must reference REAL projects/assignments from the record above and read like accomplishments, not course descriptions.

## Output Format
Respond ONLY with a JSON object, no prose, no markdown fences:
{{
  "headline": "One-line positioning, e.g. 'CS undergrad — systems & programming languages'",
  "summary": "2-3 sentence professional summary written in third-of-resume voice. Concrete, specific, no fluff.",
  "strengths": [
    {{"skill": "Skill name", "mastery": 85, "evidence": "The specific course/project that demonstrates it"}}
  ],
  "developing": ["Skill the student is mid-mastery on and actively building"],
  "resume_bullets": [
    "Action-verb bullet grounded in a real project, e.g. 'Built a regex engine in OCaml using Thompson's construction (NFA from regular expressions)'"
  ],
  "suggested_roles": ["Concrete role title this profile is competitive for"]
}}

## Guidelines
- 4-6 strengths (mastery >= 67), each with real course evidence.
- 3-5 resume bullets, each tied to a specific assignment/project by name.
- 3-5 suggested roles, realistic for a CS undergrad with this record.
- Never claim a skill the coursework doesn't support.

    return f"""You are an interviewer preparing a candidate for a "{role}" interview. Generate questions DRILLED ON THE CANDIDATE'S REAL PROJECTS below — not generic textbook prompts. Each question should be something an interviewer could plausibly ask after reading this candidate's resume.

## Target Role

## Candidate's Real Projects & Coursework
{projects}

## Candidate's Skill Profile
{profile_summary}

## Your Task
Generate exactly {count} interview questions: a mix of technical (grounded in their projects) and behavioral. For technical ones, anchor to a specific project the candidate actually did so the prep feels personal.

## Output Format
Respond ONLY with a JSON object, no prose, no markdown fences:
{{

    {{
      "type": "technical",
      "question": "The interview question, specific and answerable",

      "answer_hint": "1-2 sentence pointer to a strong answer, referencing what the candidate actually did"
    }}
  ]
}}

## Guidelines
- ~{max(1, count - 2)} technical questions anchored to specific named projects, ~2 behavioral.
- Technical questions should test depth ('walk me through how you...', 'why did you...', 'what would break if...').
- answer_hint should reference the candidate's actual work, giving them a real edge.
- Calibrate difficulty to the role: intern = fundamentals + one project deep-dive; new-grad/quant = harder.
