Course Recommendation Prompts
=============================
Two prompts that mirror the topic_knowledge.py pattern:

1. build_course_recommendation_prompt  → fed to Gemini's build_knowledge_document
   to create a rich context doc for the Aether agent layer.
2. build_recommendation_json_prompt    → fed to Gemini's generate_json_fallback
   to extract 3 structured course recommendations as JSON.

The student is currently taking or has completed these courses:

## Student's Current / Completed Courses
{taken_block}

## Full NTU CS Module Catalog
{catalog_block}

## Your Task
Create a comprehensive knowledge document that:

1. **Student Profile** — Summarize what the student already knows based on their taken modules
2. **Available Next Modules** — List NTU modules the student has NOT taken that they are eligible for
3. **Recommendation Analysis** — For each potential next course, explain:
   - How it builds on the student's existing knowledge
   - What new skills/topics it covers
   - Career/academic relevance
4. **Top 3 Recommendations** — The 3 most valuable next courses for this student, with detailed rationale

Write as a knowledge base document, NOT a chat response.
This document will be uploaded as context for an AI agent that advises on course selection."""
