    return f"""You are building a FOCUSED KNOWLEDGE DOCUMENT for an AI study assistant.
The student has requested help with: "{query}"

Your job: create a comprehensive, well-structured knowledge document that covers
everything the AI agent needs to know to help this student study this specific topic.

## Relevant Course(s)
{course_info}

## Matching Concepts from Knowledge Graph
{concepts_block}

## Concept Connections (Prerequisite Map)
{connections_block}

## Related Assignments & Deadlines
{assignments_block}

## Relevant Lecture Notes
{notes_block}

## Your Task
Create a focused knowledge document with these sections:

1. **Topic Overview** — What this topic is, why it matters, and where it fits in the course
2. **Core Concepts** — Define each matching concept clearly with examples
3. **Prerequisites** — What the student should already know (from connections)
4. **Key Relationships** — How these concepts connect to each other and to other courses
5. **Assignment Context** — Which upcoming assignments/exams test this material
6. **Study Priority** — Based on mastery levels and deadlines, what to focus on first
7. **Practice Recommendations** — Specific things the student should practice

Write as a knowledge base document, NOT a chat response.
Be specific to the student's actual course data. Reference real assignment names and deadlines.
This document will be uploaded as context for an AI agent that helps this student study."""
