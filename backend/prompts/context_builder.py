## Raw Student Data

### Enrolled Courses
{courses_raw}

### Assignments & Deadlines
{assignments_raw}

### Lecture Notes (excerpts)
{notes_raw}

## Your Task
Transform the above raw data into a clear, comprehensive knowledge document with these sections:

1. **Student Profile** — Brief summary: what semester, which courses, general load
2. **Course Overviews** — For each course: name, key topics, what stage of semester (early/mid/late based on assignments)
3. **Upcoming Deadlines** — Sorted by urgency, include type (exam, project, homework)
4. **Key Concepts by Course** — The main academic concepts from the lecture notes, organized by course
5. **Study Priorities** — Based on deadlines and note content, what should the student focus on RIGHT NOW
6. **Cross-Course Connections** — Any concepts that appear in multiple courses (e.g., linear algebra in both MATH and CS)

Write this as a knowledge document, not a chat response.
Be specific, use the actual course/assignment names from the data.
This will be the primary reference for an AI that helps this specific student study."""
