This document will be uploaded to an AI agent (Aether) to give it "memory" of the student's mastery levels and conceptual understanding.

## Student's Knowledge Engine Data

### Core Concepts & Mastery Levels
Each concept includes the student's current mastery percentage (0-100%).
{nodes_raw}

### Foundational Connections
How the concepts connect to each other across the student's curriculum:
{edges_raw}

## Your Task
Transform this structured graph data into a clear, comprehensive knowledge document with these sections:

1. **Overall Conceptual Mastery** — A brief summary of the student's strongest and weakest academic areas.
2. **Concept Breakdown** — Detail the concepts, explicitly framing them by their mastery. Format like `[Concept Label (Course, Mastery%)]`.
3. **Critical Weaknesses** — Highlight concepts below 60% mastery that need immediate remediation.
4. **Important Connections** — Describe the most important relationships in plain English so the AI understands prerequisite dependencies.

Write this as a knowledge document, not a chat response.
Be specific and instructional so the receiving AI knows exactly what to focus on when the student asks for help.
